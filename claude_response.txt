Based on your fascinating concept for Cravetown, I've analyzed the key elements needed for your starting agricultural scene. Here's a comprehensive framework for the initial setting:
Starting Geography: River Valley Settlement
The Thornwick Vale - A fertile river valley with natural class divisions:

Upper Slopes: Stone manor houses with commanding views, private gardens, and stables
River Bottom: Rich agricultural land with scattered farmhouses and field systems
Town Center: Market square built around a river crossing, with the mill, inn, and shops
Trade Route: River provides natural highway for merchant boats and future expansion

Initial Population & Social Structure
The Landed Elite (30-40 people)

Location: 3 stone manor houses on elevated ground
Current Cravings: Exotic spices, fine wine, imported silks, rare books, skilled entertainers
Buildings: Manor halls, private chapels, walled gardens, extensive stables
Power: Control 70% of fertile land, have armed retainers

Merchant Class (60-80 people)

Location: Town center around market square
Current Cravings: Social recognition, new trade connections, literacy, quality tools, marriage into elite families
Buildings: Two-story shops with living quarters, the main inn/tavern, warehouses
Power: Control local trade, emerging guild organizations

Yeoman Farmers (80-120 people)

Location: Scattered farmsteads on moderately good land
Current Cravings: Better seeds/livestock, farm improvements, protection from bad harvests, education for children
Buildings: Modest farmhouses, barns, shared community ovens
Power: Own their land but depend on markets controlled by others

Peasant Workers (200-250 people)

Location: Simple cottages near manor farms and in town outskirts
Current Cravings: Food security, warm clothing, occasional festivals, safety from bandits, basic healthcare
Buildings: One-room cottages, shared livestock pens, communal wells
Power: Provide essential labor but have little political influence

Starting Buildings & Infrastructure
Elite Quarter

Thornwick Manor (Lord Aldric's seat)
Millhaven Estate (Lady Cordelia's holdings)
Ironhold House (The Blackwood family compound)
Private armory and guard barracks
Ornate stone chapel

Town Center

Market Square: Weekly markets where all classes interact
The Riverside Mill: Water-powered grain mill (future industrial seed)
The Golden Sheaf Inn: Social hub and information center
Master Willem's Forge: Blacksmith serving all social levels
St. Aelred's Church: Wooden structure for common worship
Guild Hall: Simple meeting place for emerging merchant organization

Agricultural Infrastructure

The Great Granary: Stone storehouse controlled by governor
Riverside Docks: Simple wooden platform for trade boats
Common Fields: Shared grazing and farming areas
The Old Bridge: Wooden crossing requiring regular maintenance
Watchtower: Simple wooden structure for security

Resource Flows & Trade
Local Production

Primary: Wheat, barley, oats (agricultural surplus for export)
Secondary: Wool, livestock, timber, clay pottery, ale
Specialty: River fish, honey, medicinal herbs

Import Dependencies

Elite Essentials: Spices, wine, silk, jewelry, weapons
Common Necessities: Salt, metal tools, certain medicines
Luxury Aspirations: Sugar, exotic foods, books, fine cloth

Trade Dynamics

Monthly river caravans from downstream cities
Seasonal overland traders from hill country
Governor controls the granary - key leverage point
Elite consumption drives most import demand

Built-in Tensions & Evolution Seeds
Immediate Craving Conflicts

The Spice Dilemma: Elite want imported luxuries, but this reduces grain reserves for peasant food security
The Labor Question: Whose fields get priority during planting/harvest seasons?
The Mill Problem: Grain processing bottleneck creates power dynamics
The Immigration Challenge: New arrivals bring skills but threaten existing workers

Proto-Industrial Elements

Water Mill: Already present technology that can evolve into textile production
Merchant Capital: Growing wealth seeking investment opportunities
Trade Networks: Established routes for importing new technologies
Skill Base: Blacksmiths and craftsmen ready to scale up operations

Governor's Starting Dilemmas

Trade Allocation: Export surplus grain for elite luxuries, or keep it for peasant food security?
Immigration Policy: Welcome skilled workers who threaten locals, or maintain stability?
Resource Investment: Improve fortifications for security, or expand agricultural infrastructure?
Class Relations: Favor elite patrons who provide military support, or popular classes who provide labor?

Evolution Pathway Toward Industry
Years 1-10: Agricultural Intensification

Mill improvements → textile workshop conversion
Road building → expanded trade networks
Population growth → labor specialization pressure

Years 10-25: Manufacturing Emergence

Workshop system develops in textile, metalwork
Banking emerges to finance larger projects
Steam power introduction creates upheaval

Years 25-40: Industrial Transition

Factory system displaces traditional crafts
Railroad connections transform trade
New social classes emerge: industrial workers, entrepreneurs
Old elite either adapt or decline

This starting scenario creates natural gameplay around your core "craving management" mechanic, with every decision creating cascading effects across social classes while setting up the inevitable transformation toward industrial civilization.
