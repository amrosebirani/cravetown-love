# Personality Trait Craving Dimension Multipliers - Recommendations

## Overview

This document provides recommended multiplier values for each personality trait across all 10 coarse dimensions and 66 fine dimensions, with logical reasoning for each recommendation.

**Multiplier Key:**
- `1.0` = Normal/baseline craving
- `< 1.0` = Reduced craving (e.g., 0.7 = 30% less intense)
- `> 1.0` = Increased craving (e.g., 1.5 = 50% more intense)
- Recommended range: `0.3` to `2.5` (except for addicts on vice)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Array Order**: Fine dimensions must be in index order (0-65). The arrays above follow this order.

2. **Validation**: Sum of multipliers should generally stay reasonable:
   - Most traits: Total coarse multipliers between 9.0 and 11.0
   - Extreme traits (Addict, Ascetic): May deviate more

3. **Balance Considerations**:
   - No single multiplier should exceed 2.5 except for Addict's vice
   - No multiplier should go below 0.2 except for Ascetic's vice
   - Changes should be thematic and consistent with trait psychology

4. **Testing**: After implementing, test with various commodity distributions to ensure traits create meaningfully different experiences without breaking game balance.
